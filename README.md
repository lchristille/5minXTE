# 5minXTE
A project for my diocese

It's my first complete application for iOs. It served as a guidebook for an event organized by my diocese.
This application is currently on the appstore (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/5minxte/id1101200548?mt=8)

It's composed by four tab:
* Presentation of the event
* Scrollable list of parabolas of misercordy
* Map for direction to the event
* Changing instruction for every evening of event
